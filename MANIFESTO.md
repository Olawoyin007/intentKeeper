# The IntentKeeper Manifesto

> "The content isn't the problem. The intent behind it is."

## What This Is

IntentKeeper is a digital bodyguard for your mind. It sits between you and the content designed to hijack your attention, your emotions, and your time.

It doesn't censor topics. It surfaces manipulation.

A post about politics can be thoughtful analysis or manufactured outrage. A health tip can be genuine advice or fearmongering. IntentKeeper classifies the **energy** behind the words — not the words themselves.

## Core Principles

### 1. Surface, Don't Censor

IntentKeeper never decides what you can and cannot see. It **labels intent** and lets you decide. Blur, tag, and hide are suggestions — every piece of content can be revealed with a click.

Censorship is someone else deciding for you. Transparency is giving you information to decide for yourself.

### 2. Local-First, Always

All classification happens on your device via Ollama. Your browsing patterns, the content you consume, your sensitivity settings — none of it leaves your machine. Ever.

No cloud. No analytics. No "improving our models with your data." Your mind is yours.

### 3. Fail Open, Not Closed

When classification fails — server down, model error, network issue — content passes through unchanged. IntentKeeper will never block you from seeing something because of a bug.

False negatives (missing manipulation) are acceptable. False positives (blocking genuine content) are not.

### 4. Intent Over Topic

We will never filter by subject matter. Political content is not inherently manipulative. Health content is not inherently fearmongering. Spiritual content is not inherently divisive.

The same topic can be expressed with genuine intent or manipulative intent. We classify the framing, not the subject.

### 5. User Sovereignty

You control everything:
- What gets filtered and what doesn't
- How aggressively it filters
- Which platforms it runs on
- Whether it runs at all

IntentKeeper is a tool, not a guardian. It serves you; you don't serve it.

### 6. No Engagement Optimization

IntentKeeper will never:
- Track how long you spend on filtered vs unfiltered content
- A/B test different filter presentations for "effectiveness"
- Gamify the experience (streaks, badges, scores)
- Nudge you to use it more
- Send notifications

The best outcome is that you internalize the patterns and stop needing IntentKeeper.

### 7. Transparency in Classification

Every classification comes with a reasoning field. You can always see **why** content was flagged. If the reasoning doesn't make sense, the classification is wrong — and the content should be treated as genuine.

We don't hide behind "trust the algorithm." We show our work.

## What We Won't Build

- **Topic filters**: We classify intent, not subjects. No political filters, no religion filters.
- **User profiling**: We don't build models of what you like or dislike.
- **Social features**: No sharing, no leaderboards, no "your friends are using IntentKeeper."
- **Premium manipulation detection**: All features are free. We don't gate safety behind paywalls.
- **Notification systems**: We don't interrupt you. We're there when you're already browsing.

## The Attention Economy Problem

Every major platform optimizes for engagement. Engagement is driven by emotion. The strongest emotions — outrage, fear, tribal identity — are the easiest to manufacture.

The result: your feed is optimized to make you angry, afraid, and divided. Not because the platform is evil, but because that's what the algorithm rewards.

IntentKeeper doesn't fix the platforms. It gives you a lens to see the manipulation before it affects you. Once you see the pattern, you can't unsee it.

## On Imperfection

IntentKeeper will make mistakes. It will:
- Flag genuine content as manipulative (false positive)
- Miss actual manipulation (false negative)
- Struggle with sarcasm, irony, and cultural context
- Disagree with your judgment sometimes

That's okay. IntentKeeper is a second opinion, not an authority. When it disagrees with you, trust yourself.

## Relationship to empathySync

IntentKeeper is a sibling project to [empathySync](https://github.com/Olawoyin007/empathySync). Both share the same philosophy:

| Principle | empathySync | IntentKeeper |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Local-first** | All AI processing on-device | All classification on-device |
| **Restraint** | Limits itself on sensitive topics | Labels but never censors |
| **Human primacy** | Redirects to human connection | Gives users information to decide |
| **Anti-engagement** | Optimizes for user exit | Doesn't track or nudge |
| **Transparency** | Shows why guardrails fire | Shows classification reasoning |

empathySync protects you from over-relying on AI for emotional support.
IntentKeeper protects you from content designed to manipulate your emotions.

Same mission, different surface areas.

## The Living Clause

This manifesto evolves only to **tighten** protections, never to weaken them. Any change that loosens user privacy, adds tracking, enables censorship, or introduces engagement optimization violates the spirit of this document.

If IntentKeeper ever contradicts these principles, the principles win.
